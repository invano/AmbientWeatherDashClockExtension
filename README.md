AmbientWeatherDashClockExtension
================================

Ambient Weather is a DashClock Extension that shows the current temperature, relative humidity and pressure. All the data are retrieved directly from the built-in sensors.
Moreover,it is battery friendly. The readings are taken just once everytime you access the lockscreen.

Please note:
* This app is an extension for DashClock Widget (http://goo.gl/qs1jB). Ambient Weather cannot run without it.
* Ambient Weather cannot run on devices without ambient thermometer, hygrometer and barometer. Read the COMPATIBILITY list below.
* Since Android requires a small time interval to start receiving data from sensors, the data are updated ~1sec after the screen turns on.
* Do not install or rate this app if your device does not have a barometer, hygrometer and ambient thermometer.

Compatibility (at the moment):
- Samsung Galaxy S4
- Samsung Galaxy Note 3
